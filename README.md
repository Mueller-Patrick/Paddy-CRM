# Running the application
Running the application is pretty straightforward. If you use IntelliJ IDEA,
you should be able to just clone the repo, open it in IntelliJ and run the ```Main.kt```
class in the ```plugins```-Package.

This should also work with eclipse but I haven't testet it. Running the application should also be possible
by running ```gradle run``` in the root directory of the project.

## Running the tests
To run the tests, you can either open them in your IDE and run them manually or run ```gradle test```.
